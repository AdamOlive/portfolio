        <h1>Crayta - Hub</h1>
        <p>
          The Hub is the ever-changing heart of Crayta, and a large part of my
          role has been to update it with seasonal content and minigames, as
          well as overseeing a major design refresh to ensure it was as
          effective as possible at grabbing players' attention, and telling them
          what Crayta's all about.

          <h2>Hub Redesign</h2>
          <p>
            For a couple of years, Crayta had a largely white, wide-open,
            abstract hub, but more and more I felt that this wasn't showing
            Crayta to its full artistic potential. Additionally, it was
            difficult for the artists to apply seasonal theming, and for me to
            add minigames in a consistent place, and it didn't facilitate social
            interaction as well as it could.

            <br /><br />I researched other central spaces in social games and
            UGC platforms, as well as looking at physical "hubs" such as
            airports and train stations. I came up with 3 measurable objectives
            for the new Hub that I hypothesised would improve overall retention
            in Crayta, particularly for new users. Working with the art team, I
            created and iterated on a new hub design, including a new aesthetic
            and layout, to meet my 3 objectives. The objectives, in short, were
            to give a powerful impression of Crayta as a high fidelity creative
            platform, to connect players with the best UGC experiences, and to
            facilitate social interactions.

          <h2>Tabletop Champs Hub</h2>
          <p>
            For this most recent hub update, I opted to build a set of board
            games that would provide a unique experience for players that hadn't
            been done in Crayta before, as well as providing these as packages
            so that other creators could easily enhance their own social spaces.
            Additionally, they showcase the new dragging input method for touch
            devices.

            <br /><br />The games include Tic Tac Toe, Checkers and Chess. I
            started with Tac Tac Toe as the lowest complexity game, to build,
            iterate and polish the game loop and drag mechanics, before diving
            into the more complex validation checks for Checkers, and finally
            Chess, which includes full checks for valid checkmate, castling and
            en passant.

            <br /><br />This last hub has seen the highest average session
            lengths as a proportion of overall session lengths in Crayta.

        <h2>Harrowing High Hub</h2>
        <p>
          The Harrowing High art content was truly inspiring, particularly the
          monster avatar outfits, and I wanted to create a hub that showcased
          one of these as an NPC to inspire creators to use the outfits in their
          own creations.

          <br /><br />This hub update had a particularly ambitious game, in
          which players could enter a school and see how long they could survive
          for. An AI monster would hunt the players with an A* pathfinding
          algorithm, built as a Lua package that I had also provided to
          community creators.

        <h2>Cybotanica Hub</h2>
        <p>
          With development time being extremely short for Cybotanica, I opted to
          try a new approach with the Cybotanica Hub, using it to showcase
          community creativity rather, than creating a minigame as most of the
          other hubs had.

          <br /><br />The Cybotanica Hub had a "sculpture garden" area that
          showcased 3 sculptures, which were scripted to rotate weekly. They
          were initially populated by 3 of my sculptures, which included a
          miniature city, a robot NPC "charging up", and a dancing robot made up
          of retro parts such as an old PC, which were attached to different
          sockets on a hidden NPC to create the effect of a character built from
          junk.

        <h2>Cursed Galleons Hub</h2>
        <p>
          The Cursed Galleons season spanned across the major Hub redesign, and
          therefore had to fit both designs seamlessly. This season was also
          full of pirate assets, but critically we didn't have a full pirate
          ship yet - something that would be technically as well as artistically
          challenging to build using Crayta's voxel + mesh system.

          <br /><br />I decided to build a hidden object game, with daily
          randomised object positions, set in a pirate ship. I also built the
          ship, from a number of carefully rotated voxel pieces giving the
          appearance of rounded sides and smooth curves. Being contained within
          the ship, the game could easily be transferred between hub layouts. I
          released the ship as a community package, and it saw use in a wide
          variety of UGC games.

        <h2>Strength and Sorcery Hub</h2>
        <p>
          The Strength and Sorcery season's assets focused on two contrasting
          themes - the "strength" side, including knights and castles, and the
          "sorcery" side, including potions and magical woodland elements.

          <br /><br />To complement the season's assets, I designed a hub with
          each side being one of those themes, and a team-based asynchronous
          crafting battle game that took place between them. Each week, players
          could join one of the team's, and find ingredients hidden around the
          Hub to craft projectiles, which were shot from a cannon at the other
          team's side. Damage was stored as a global counter, and was reflected
          by environmental changes, with the buildings becoming more damaged
          over time.
