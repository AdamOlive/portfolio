          <h2>Hub Redesign</h2>
          <p>
            For a couple of years, Crayta had a largely white, wide-open,
            abstract hub, but more and more I felt that this wasn't showing
            Crayta to its full artistic potential. Additionally, it was
            difficult for the artists to apply seasonal theming, and for me to
            add minigames in a consistent place, and it didn't facilitate social
            interaction as well as it could.

            <br /><br />I researched other central spaces in social games and
            UGC platforms, as well as looking at physical "hubs" such as
            airports and train stations. I came up with 3 measurable objectives
            for the new Hub that I hypothesised would improve overall retention
            in Crayta, particularly for new users. Working with the art team, I
            created and iterated on a new hub design, including a new aesthetic
            and layout, to meet my 3 objectives. The objectives, in short, were
            to give a powerful impression of Crayta as a high fidelity creative
            platform, to connect players with the best UGC experiences, and to
            facilitate social interactions.

          <h2>Tabletop Champs Hub</h2>
          <p>
            For this most recent hub update, I opted to build a set of board
            games that would provide a unique experience for players that hadn't
            been done in Crayta before, as well as providing these as packages
            so that other creators could easily enhance their own social spaces.
            Additionally, they showcase the new dragging input method for touch
            devices.

            <br /><br />The games include Tic Tac Toe, Checkers and Chess. I
            started with Tac Tac Toe as the lowest complexity game, to build,
            iterate and polish the game loop and drag mechanics, before diving
            into the more complex validation checks for Checkers, and finally
            Chess, which includes full checks for valid checkmate, castling and
            en passant.

            <br /><br />This last hub has seen the highest average session
            lengths as a proportion of overall session lengths in Crayta.
