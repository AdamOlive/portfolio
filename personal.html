        <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
        <p>
          I've had a passion for game design and development since I discovered
          Scratch at age 11, and I've enjoyed making films for even longer.
          After leaving school, I released 2 Unity games, and landed my first
          job as a UI programmer at Pixel Toys. Since then I've continued to
          learn new creative skills, I've released another Unity game, and I'm
          now taking a part-time film course with the NFTS.

          <h2>Mega Maths</h2>
          <p>
            I created Mega Maths because someone close to me needed more help,
            and practice, with their maths, and I decided it would be a
            worthwhile project to create an easy-to-use app that teaches Key
            Stage 1 maths in a cute, child-friendly and rewarding way.
            <br /><br />
            The app has 100 worded questions, localised into 4 languages, as
            well as random question modes in easy, medium, hard and expert
            difficulty. The random modes each have a stats page, where a parent
            can see a graph of their child's success rate per session.

          <h2>AlienX</h2>
          <p>
            AlienX was one of my first game projects - a game I created in
            GameMaker Studio while I was at school. It won the BAFTA Young Game
            Designer's Game-Making award in 2014.
            <br /><br />
            Alienx was a crossover of Lemmings and a tower defence. Across a
            variety of maps, different types of aliens would spawn and try to
            cross from left to right, attacking your base. You could place traps
            such as bombs, water sprinklers, and even simple electrical
            connectors to manipulate the environment and try to prevent the
            aliens from crossing the map.

          <h2>Photography</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of game-making, I love nature and wildlife photography, as
            well as film-making. I'm currently taking a part-time film-making
            certificate course with the National Film and Television School, to
            expand my creative skillset, teaching me transferable skills like
            directing, production, lighting and composition.
