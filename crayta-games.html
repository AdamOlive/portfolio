        <h1>Crayta - Games</h1>
        <p>
          I've designed and developed a number of small games in collaboration
          with environment artists and UI designers, testing out the limits of
          Crayta's toolset and providing design feedback on editor features,
          such as particle effects, touch screen input systems and the Lua API.

          <h2>Prop Hunt</h2>
          <p>
            Prop Hunt is one of Crayta's most played games, with over 250,000
            plays. Prop Hunt is a game mode present in other UGC platforms, such
            as Garry's Mod, but I tweaked the design for this one to cater for
            Crayta's more casual, largely mobile audience.
            <br /><br />
            The inputs are very simple, with only one input needed for each
            player, aside from movement. The Prop players can toggle to a
            randomly selected prop, and the Hunter can shoot. Updates made
            during user testing include a radar to allow the Hunter to find a
            Prop player if they've gone too long without moving, and a CCTV
            system so caught players can still watch the action from various
            viewpoints.

          <h2>Summer Sports</h2>
          <p>
            Summer Sports was a time-limited event game for summer 2022. It
            consisted of 4 sports-based minigames in a bubbly, abstract, Fall
            Guys-like environment. The game proved excellent for fostering
            competition in our player community thanks to the array of
            leaderboards and cosmetic prizes.
            <br /><br />
            Although the game itself was time-limited, I made it remixable, to
            multiply its benefits by allowing the creator community to learn
            from it, and create their own games from the solid foundations
            provided, which proved popular with other sports-based games
            released as a result.

          <h2>Power Run</h2>
          <p>
            I created Power Run in my own time as I wanted to push some limits
            of Crayta that my work, at the time, wouldn't have crossed over
            with. It's a procedurally generated endless runner with a unique
            mechanic, that lets you jump and "spin" 90 degrees left or right,
            and run along the walls.
            <br /><br />
            Not many games in Crayta had procedural generation, so I created
            (and shared) a flexible object pooling package to handle the rapid
            creation and destruction of track pieces and obstacles. The spin
            mechanic was also tricky, since Crayta has no controls over gravity,
            so the entire track rotates around you. To make this convincing, I
            delayed the camera rotation, so it appears that the player spins,
            and the camera "catches up". It was a fantastic test of some
            difficult mechanics, but if I worked on it again, I'd simplify and
            automate more of the controls to reduce complexity for the user, and
            improve the experience for mobile.
