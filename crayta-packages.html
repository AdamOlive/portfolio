        <h1>Crayta - Packages</h1>
        <p>
          It's hugely important to me to empower community creators wherever
          possible. This meant I was always looking to create and share useful
          Crayta packages - collections of scripts and other assets - to allow
          creators to build better content, more easily.

          <h2>Dialog Tree</h2>
          <p>
            Wanting to make a Hub event with an interactable NPC, I decided to
            start by creating a general-purpose dialog tree package. This
            allowed me to create and iterate the dialog quickly, but more
            importantly, it allowed the community creators to easily add
            interactable NPCs to their own games.
            <br /><br />
            The dialog tree was simple for creators of any ability to set up,
            but incredibly powerful and versatile. Creators were quick to adopt
            it, and it appeared in at least 3 of the winning games from the
            November 2022 game jam. A dialog message can have any number of
            responses, which can connect to more messages, trigger events, and
            play emotes on the NPC. Additionally, a number of UI properties are
            exposed, allowing creators to easily customise colours, sizing and
            more on the dialog UI.

          <h2>Touch Controls</h2>
          <p>
            I worked with the UI/UX team on designing touch controls, when we
            released Crayta on Facebook Gaming and expanded to large mobile
            audience. We wanted to empower creators to make their games just as
            fun on mobile as PC, and added a number of features such as drag
            detection, which I helped design and give feedback on.
            <br /><br />
            We created a Touch UI remixable game so creators could take
            mechanics across to their own games. This included two mechanics I
            created - a tappable hidden object game, and a Rush Hour-style
            puzzle game of dragging blocks along their axes to "free" a target
            block. Both of these demo mechanics were turned into full games by
            community creators.

          <h2>Smooth Path and Filming Camera</h2>
          <p>
            While the smooth path and filming camera are two separate packages,
            they fit together excellently for use in game trailers, for example.
            <br /><br />
            The smooth path package allows players to place path points in their
            world, and the package will automatically move a given object along
            a spline through those points, with customisable speed at each
            point.
            <br /><br />
            The filming camera package contains a suite of tools to help
            creators film their creations. You can switch between modes such as
            free cam, attaching to objects, and tracking players. You can adjust
            position, rotation, FOV and even the speed at which these change.
            You can toggle thirds lines, set a marker position to return to,
            trigger in-world events, and move all players to the camera for
            quick filming. Other players can also see a camera mesh in-game,
            which helped hugely in filming trailers.
