          The Hub is the ever-changing heart of Crayta, and a large part of my
          role has been the 0 - 1 design and implementation of Hub updates with
          seasonal content and minigames, as well as overseeing a major design
          refresh to ensure it was as effective as possible at grabbing players'
          attention, and giving it a strong personality to tell players what
          Crayta's all about.

          <h2>Hub Redesign</h2>
          <p>
            For a couple of years, Crayta had a largely white, wide-open,
            abstract hub, but more and more I felt that this wasn't showing
            Crayta to its full artistic potential. Additionally, it was
            difficult for the artists to apply seasonal theming, and for me to
            add minigames in a consistent place, and it didn't facilitate social
            interaction as well as it could.

            <br /><br />I researched other central spaces in social games and
            UGC platforms, as well as looking at physical "hubs" such as
            airports and train stations. I came up with 3 measurable objectives
            for the new Hub that I hypothesised would improve overall retention
            in Crayta, particularly for new users. Working with the art team, I
            created and iterated on a new hub design, including a new aesthetic
            and layout, to meet my 3 objectives. The objectives, in short, were
            to give a powerful impression of Crayta as a high fidelity creative
            platform, to connect players with the best UGC experiences, and to
            facilitate social interactions.
